This repository contains the source code for "Poisson approximate likelihood compared to the particle filter" by Yize Hao, Aaron A. Abkemeier and Edward L. Ionides.

It is run in R by ```knitr::knit('ms.Rnw')```

Set RUN_LEVEL = 1 in ms.Rnw for a quick test run.

delete the output_03 directory and set RUN_LEVEL = 3 to reproduce the article.

The main calculations were carried out on the greatlakes Linux cluster at University of Michigan. The session info of the cluster can be found in the file "sessionInfo.txt".
